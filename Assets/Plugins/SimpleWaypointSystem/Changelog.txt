**************************************
CHANGELOG
**************************************

v5.5.2
- fixed WaypointManager not placing new waypoints or making them invisible.
  This required a workaround due to a Unity bug only fixed in 2022.2 and above
- fixed WaypointManager not using the assigned view placement key

v5.5.1
- DOTween updated to 1.2.705
- fixed NREs on event variables when instantiating movement scripts at runtime
- changed asset root folder name, delete the old 'SWS' root folder when updating!
- changed asset documentation moving everything from included PDF file to
  online documentation page on GitLab
- changed namespace using directives for third-party packages to be included
  inside the SWS namespace, instead of outside. This should solve most clashes
  for assets not using namespaces
- removed actions for PlayMaker
- minimum required Unity version: 2020.3.0

v5.5.0
- changed events on waypoints: UnityEvents for all waypoints in the
  inspector are gone, as feedback told they were difficult to maintain.
  Instead, three UnityEvents were added: start, change (waypoint), end.
  You can also listen to these events via code on the corresponding Action.
  Be aware that when updating, your existing events need to be re-added.
  See the scripting documentation for more details and event descriptions.
- changed NavMeshAgent stoppingDistance default to 0.5 if kept at zero
- fixed splineMove not starting to play with DOTween AutoPlay set to none
- fixed documentation links

- added IsMoving() and IsPaused() convenience methods to movement scripts
- fixed multiple events being called at once when startPoint > 0
- fixed general Reverse behavior on non-pingpong paths using navMove
- minimum required Unity version: 2018.4.0

v5.4.6
- added BezierPathManager method, converting waypoint index to path point
- added CTRL+click de/selecting for moving multiple waypoints at once
- fixed events not being called on reverse paths due to wrong index
- fixed reversing on bezier paths by returning new path copy each time
- minimum required Unity version: 2017.4.16

v5.4.5
- DOTween updated to 1.2.305
- added missing startPoint indicator on navMove movement script

v5.4.4
- DOTween updated to 1.2.235
