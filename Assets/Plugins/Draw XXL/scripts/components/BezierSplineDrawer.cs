There are constructions how this is possible via using "[SerializeReference]", but serialized lists/arrays/reorderableList seem not to be fully compatible with it. Obscure errors appear, for example when clicking the "choose presets symbol" in the component inspector, then these lists dissolve into nullRefExceptions, even if there aren't any presets available. Also other obscure errors for reorderable list like "list item not found" after deleting control points via custom buttons.
        //-> see also Unitys documenation on Serialization: "Avoid nested, recursive structures where you reference other classes."
        //-> Therefore the cross references of the subItems are implemented via fake properties: They don't "reference each other", but they reference only the list-carrying MonoBehaviour-inherited spline-component here and ask for the position of the "(quasi)referenced" other subItem inside the (quasi)struct. References from other gameobjects (that are bound to controlSubPoints via the "SplineConnection"-component) have to act in the same way: They cannot reference the subPoint where they are bound to "directly", but have to obtain it via the position inside the list-(quasi)struct.

            //-> Sidenote: Unitys documentation states that "Awake()" and "Start()" get called only once in the lifetime of a component. Thought there are still cases where this may be not fully true, or at least ambiguous: 
            //---> Case 1: If you create a component, then Awake()/Start() get called the first time. Then delete the component. Then undo the deletion with Unitys build-in Undo-functionality -> Awake()/Start() fire again.
            //---> Case 2: If you create a component (first time Awake()/Start()), then copy the component, or the whole gameobject -> Awake()/Start() fire again. It is of course a new component, so the statement, that each component gets his Awake()/Start() only once is true, but if you initialize same data inside Awake()/Start(), then the already initialized data also gets copied to the new component. So then at least the DATA "has seen Awake()/Start() twice".
            //---> Case 3: If you create the component in Edit mode (first time Awake()/Start()), then enter Playmode: -> Awake()/Start() fire again. Similar to "Case 2": The component is created newly onPlaymodeStart, so it is a "new" component...but it's data has seen "Awake()/Start()" twice.

            //-> "CreateFirstTwoControlPointsOfNewlyCreatedSpline()" should be executed in "Start()" and not in "Awake()", because:
            //-> Unitys behaviour when copying a component in the editor seems to be somehow inconsistent.
            //-> It can be observed at the "splineIsAlreadyInitialized"-bool.
            //-> This bool is set to "true" as soon as a component is created, and from then on is never touched, so remains at "true" forever.
            //-> When copying such a component which already has "splineIsAlreadyInitialized == true", there are different behaviours:
            //---> When copying "the whole gameobject that hosts the component", then "splineIsAlreadyInitialized" is true in "Awake()" and "Start()" of the copied componet. This is as expected, because it's just a copy of the previous component, which already has it's "splineIsAlreadyInitialized" at true. 
            //---> Though when "copying only the component and attaching it somewhere else" (be it as copy on the same hosting gameobject or onto another gameobject) then "splineIsAlreadyInitialized" is "false" in "Awake()" (and in "OnEnable()"), but is "true" in "Start()". Maybe in this case internally a new component is created from scratch, and then AFTER firing "Awake()" and "OnEnable()" the serialized copied data is applied to the newly created object. The same behaviour happens for "create spline component -> undo create -> redo create".
            //-> Why does it matter?
            //---> The first two controlPoints are already created upfront when creating a new spline component from scratch. Though when copying an existing spline then there shouldn't be two additonal controlPoints added automatically. This behaviour depends on the "splineIsAlreadyInitialized"-bool
            //---> More serious though is this: The Undo-functionality of the Editor can get into an errorneous state:
            //------> If the assignments and functions called here in "Start()"-function would instead be executed in "Awake()" for a copied component, then the following sequences of actions produces the following repruducible errors (in Unity 2019.4 LTS):
            //--------> Sequence 1:
            //----------> Create spline component
            //----------> Then "Undo" produces these error log messages: "CheckConsistency: GameObject does not reference component MonoBehaviour. Fixing." and "MissingReferenceException: The object of type 'BezierSplineDrawer' has been destroyed but you are still trying to access it." and "GUI Error: You are pushing more GUIClips than you are popping. Make sure they are balanced."
            //----------> Then "Redo" crashes the Unity editor
            //--------> Sequence 2:
            //----------> Create spline component
            //----------> Copy spline component to clipboard
            //----------> Paste spline component as new (no matter if as copy on the same hosting gameobject or onto another gameobject)
            //----------> So far it works.
            //----------> But then "Undo" produces the same error mesages as in "Sequence 1": "CheckConsistency: ..." etc.
            //----------> Then "Redo" crashes the Unity editor
            //------> Other components don't have this problem. It might have something to do with the serialized list that is contained in this class.
